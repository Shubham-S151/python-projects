# Bank atm code
## Overview
This project is a simple bank login page implemented in Python. It allows users to log in, register, check their balance, withdraw cash, and change their password using data stored in an Excel file.

## Features
- User login and registration
- Cash withdrawal
- Balance inquiry
- Change card password
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- numpy library
- An Excel file containing sample bank data
  -Sample Data Structure
    - The Excel file should have the following columns:
      - username
      - password
      - firstname
      - lastname
      - accnum (account number)
      - balance
You can create a sample Excel file named sample data for bank login code.xlsx with the necessary data in your specified directory.

## Installation
### Clone the repository:

- Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
### Install the required libraries:

- Copy code
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
## Usage
1. Make sure to update the path to your Excel file in the script:

df = pd.read_excel(r"C:\Users\HP\Desktop\bank atm code\sample data for bank login code.xlsx")

2. Run the script:

atm code.py

3. Follow the prompts to log in or register a new account.

## Code Explanation
Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the code functionality:

- Data Import: The bank data is loaded from an Excel file using the pandas library.
- Login and Registration: Users can log in with their username and password. If they are not registered, they can register - directly through the prompt.
- Banking Operations: Users can choose from several operations:
  - Cash withdrawal
  - Balance inquiry
  - Change card password
- Data Persistence: The code currently updates the DataFrame in memory but does not save changes back to the Excel file. You can extend the functionality to save the updated DataFrame.
## Example Usage
When prompted, you can enter your username and password. If they match the records, you'll be welcomed and given options for banking operations.
